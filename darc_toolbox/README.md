# The `darc` package

This code is based upon the preprint:
> Vincent, B. T., & Rainforth, T. (2017, October 20). The DARC Toolbox: automated, flexible, and efficient delayed and risky choice experiments using Bayesian adaptive design. Retrieved from [psyarxiv.com/yehjb](https://psyarxiv.com/yehjb)

The original code was implemented by Tom Rainforth and Benjamin T. Vincent in Matlab. Ben then later ported it to Python.

The `darc` package builds upon core Bayesian Adaptive Design code (implemented in the `bad` package). It allows you to do Bayesian Adative Design in the context of Delayed And Risky Choices.
