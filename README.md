# darc-experiments-python

## Status:  üî• Under active development. This is pre-alpha code. üî• 

## What does this do?
The aim is to be able to run experiments using Bayesian Adaptive Design, using the approach set out in [Vincent & Rainforth, 2017](https://psyarxiv.com/yehjb). This was originally implemented in Matlab code in the [darc-experiments-matlab](https://github.com/drbenvincent/darc-experiments-matlab) repo, but I am porting this to Python.

Further, we are embedding this Bayesian Adaptive Design code within the [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org) experiment framework.


## Features

### Core features
Feature | Status | Info
--- | --- | ---
Run DARC experiments in PsychoPy | ‚úÖ |
Exporting of data | ‚úÖ | Exports raw trial-level data. Also exports parameters (both summary statistics and full posterior distribution)
Run simulated experiments | ‚ùå | 
Choose design and models via GUI | ‚ùå | At this point we rely on very minor changes to the PsychoPy code snippets to select model and design preferences.

### Design paradigms
Paradigm | Status | Info
--- | --- | ---
Kirby paradigm | ‚úÖ | Fixed design, delay discounting only
Frye et al paradigm | ‚úÖ | Adaptive (heuristic) approach, delay discounting only

## Requirements
This code is being developed with:
- Python 3
- To run experiments you will also need [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org), currently using their Python 3 release, version 1.90.1. I'll probably update to PsychoPy 3 before we make any kind of official release.
