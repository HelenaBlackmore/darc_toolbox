# darc-experiments-python

## Status:  ðŸ”¥ Under active development. This is pre-alpha code. ðŸ”¥ 

## What does this do?
The aim is to be able to run experiments using Bayesian Adaptive Design, using the approach set out in [Vincent & Rainforth, 2017](https://psyarxiv.com/yehjb). This was originally implemented in Matlab code in the [darc-experiments-matlab](https://github.com/drbenvincent/darc-experiments-matlab) repo, but I am porting this to Python.

Further, we are embedding this Bayesian Adaptive Design code within the [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org) experiment framework.


## Requirements
This code is being developed with:
- Python 3
- To run experiments you will also need [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org), currently using their Python 3 release, version 1.90.1. I'll probably update to PsychoPy 3 before we make any kind of official release.
